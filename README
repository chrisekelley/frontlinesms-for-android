FrontlineSMS is award-winning free, open source software that turns a laptop and a mobile phone into a central communications hub.

What you communicate is up to you, making FrontlineSMS useful in many different ways. See www.frontlinesms.com for more information.

This github project "FrontlineSMS for Android" is a port of the desktop application to the Android platform, so that users don't need a PC + phone anymore but can handle their SMS programs with an Android powered smartphone only.
